# Australian_Vehicle_Price_Prediction
Machine Learning to predict Australian car prices
This model is helpful both for the used car buyers and sellers for predicting the used cars' value in Australian Market. There is a big market for used cars. Since the used cars' price depends on so many characteristics, this model tries to simplify the prediction for the common benefit.

In this Project, we are going to predict the Price of Used Cars using various features like Present_Price, Selling_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Year etc. The data used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle.
